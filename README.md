# FACIAL RECOGNITION GROUP PROJECT

## Website presentation: https://sfissel.github.io/celebrityfacialrecognition.io/

## Intro/Problem:
Facial recognition technology relies on massive datasets to “learn” faces to accurately identify or verify the identity of a person. It captures, analyzes, and compares patterns based on a person’s facial features. Facial biometrics continues to be the preferred biometric benchmark above all other methods because it’s easy to deploy and implement, does not require any physical interaction with the end-user, and is very quick.

Facial recognition is now being implemented across many industries because of its wide applicability, benefits, and convenience. Many issues, small and large, that we once faced a decade ago are being solved thanks to this technology.

For example, it can be used to:
- Help find missing people and identify perpetrators
- Protect businesses against theft
- Improve medical treatment, mainly for genetic disorders
- Strengthen security measures in banks and airports as preventative measure
- Unlock sensitive information on mobile devices
- Make shopping more efficient
- Drastically reduce human touchpoints, especially during the pandemic
- Help organize photos

## Question: 
### **Can we create multiple machine learning models that accurately identify and detect the correct person from a particular group of people with similarities in their appearances?**
